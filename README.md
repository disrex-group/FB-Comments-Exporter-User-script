## Overview

The Facebook Comment Scraper is a powerful userscript that enables you to scrape and export comments from Facebook posts, including full support for nested replies and hierarchical comment threads. It adds a floating interface to Facebook pages with automatic comment collection, depth detection, and export to both CSV and JSON formats.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Comment Scraping**: Automatically scrolls through and collects comments from Facebook posts
- **Nested Reply Support**: Full support for multi-level comment threads (replies to replies to replies...)
- **Depth Detection**: Multiple strategies to detect comment nesting depth
- **Configurable Limit**: Set a maximum number of comments to scrape (0 for unlimited)
- **Real-time Statistics**: Shows progress including main comments, replies, and depth distribution

### Export Capabilities
- **Auto-Download JSON**: Automatically downloads JSON when scraping completes (no prompts!)
- **Hierarchical Structure**: JSON export preserves full parent-child relationships and thread nesting
- **CSV Available**: Manual CSV export option via browser console if needed
- **Rich Data**: Includes author name, profile URL, profile image, timestamp, likes, comment text, depth level, detection method

### Visual Features
- **Color-Coded Highlighting**: Comments are highlighted by depth (red=main, orange=level 1, yellow=level 2, green=level 3+)
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates showing extraction progress and data quality stats
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean floating UI with easy-to-use controls

### Advanced Detection
- **Multiple Detection Strategies**:
  1. DOM Hierarchy (nested article elements)
  2. Aria-label Pattern Matching ("Antwoord van..." / "Reply from...")
  3. Author Mention Links
  4. Visual Indentation
  5. Container Grouping
- **Robust Author Extraction**: Multiple fallback approaches to extract author names from various Facebook DOM structures
- **Debug Mode**: Built-in diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Install Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey for your browser
2. Navigate to the [raw userscript file](https://github.com/disrex-group/FB-Comments-Exporter-User-script/raw/refs/heads/master/facebook-comment-scraper.user.js)
3. Your userscript manager will prompt you to install it
4. Click "Install" to add the script

## Usage

1. Navigate to any Facebook post (works on both www.facebook.com and m.facebook.com)
2. You'll see a floating panel in the top-right corner of the page
3. Set the maximum number of comments to scrape (or 0 for unlimited)
4. Click "Start Scraping" to begin collecting comments
5. The script will automatically:
   - Expand comment sections
   - Load more comments
   - Expand replies (including nested replies)
   - Detect comment depth and hierarchy
   - Collect comprehensive comment data
   - **Download JSON export when complete** (no additional clicks needed!)
6. Watch the real-time statistics showing main comments, replies, and depth distribution
7. The JSON file (`fb_modal_YYYY-MM-DD.json`) downloads automatically to your browser's download folder
8. Check the browser console (F12) for detailed statistics and logs

## Scraped Data

The exported files include:

### All Formats
- **Author Name**: Commenter's display name
- **Profile URL**: Link to commenter's Facebook profile
- **Profile Image**: URL to profile picture
- **Comment Text**: Full comment content
- **Timestamp**: When the comment was posted
- **Likes**: Number of reactions
- **Depth**: Nesting level (0=main comment, 1=direct reply, 2=reply to reply, etc.)
- **Detection Method**: How the depth was determined

### JSON Export (Additional)
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Nested replies under parent comments
- **Parent ID**: Reference to parent comment
- **Reply To Author**: Name of the author being replied to

## Version History

### v1.1 (Current)
- 🚀 **Auto-download JSON export** - No more confirmation dialogs! JSON downloads automatically when scraping completes
- ✅ Stats logged to console instead of alert dialogs
- ✅ Cleaner UX - no interruptions, just automatic export

### v1.0 (Initial Release)
- 🎉 **Initial public release** on GitHub!
- ✅ Multi-level nested reply detection (DOM hierarchy + aria-label patterns)
- ✅ Dual export formats: CSV (flat) and JSON (hierarchical)
- ✅ Color-coded depth visualization
- ✅ Robust author extraction with multiple fallback strategies
- ✅ Profile link handling (supports query parameters)
- ✅ Smart name filtering (handles Dutch/English, timestamps, special characters)
- ✅ Support for both "Opmerking" (Comment) and "Antwoord" (Reply) aria-labels
- ✅ Real-time scraping statistics and progress tracking
- ✅ Debug mode for troubleshooting
- ✅ Automatic depth detection using 5 different strategies

## Known Limitations

- Requires comments to be loaded in the Facebook modal/dialog
- Facebook's dynamic DOM structure may require periodic updates
- Very large comment threads (1000+ comments) may take time to process
- Facebook rate limiting may affect scraping speed

## Debugging

Enable debug mode by setting `window.DEPTH_DEBUG = true` in the browser console before scraping. This will output detailed logs about:
- Depth detection strategies used
- Author extraction attempts
- DOM structure analysis
- Parent-child relationship matching

## Updates

The userscript includes automatic update checks. Your userscript manager will notify you when a new version is available.
